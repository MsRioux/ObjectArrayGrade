# ObjectArrayGrade

# Programming Practice 6.1

Modify the GradeRange program (Classwork 6.0) so that it doesnâ€™t use parallel arrays.  Instead, design a new class called Grade that stores both the grade string and its cutoff value (the lowest score for that grade). Set both values using the Grade constructor and provide methods that return the values.  In the main method of the new GradeRange program, fill a single array with Grade objects, then produce the same output as the original GradeRange program did.


# Assignment Expectations
You should have two classes, a concrete and a driver
Watch for RiouxStyle requirements
The output should be exactly the same as the Classwork.
